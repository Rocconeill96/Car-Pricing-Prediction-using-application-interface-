## Graphical User Interface
The focus of the GUI was to make it simply and easy to use. This was important because when users are presented with a complex or confusing interface, it makes it more inaccesible and reduces user engagement.

To aid the user, extra bits of functionality were added to enhance the experience:
- kilometre to miles conversion
- PferdStarke (PS) to Brake Horse Power (BHP)
- CC to litres
- Pounds to dollars/ euros conversion using [real time api](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
