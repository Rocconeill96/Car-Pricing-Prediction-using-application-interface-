# Car-machine-learning-model
Development of a car machine learning model using publicly available data


## Webscraping
- After considering several websites, the team decided to utilize [Autotrader](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) used to scrape the data

The variables included were:
- Price
- Mileage
- Body type
- Make
- Model 
- Power
- Engine size
- Year
- Transmission
- Fuel type

## Graphical User Interface
The focus of the GUI was to make it simply and easy to use. This was important because when users are presented with a complex or confusing interface, it makes it more inaccesible and reduces user engagement.

To aid the user, extra bits of functionality were added to enhance the experience:
- kilometre to miles conversion
- PferdStarke (PS) to Brake Horse Power (BHP)
- CC to litres
- Pounds to dollars/ euros conversion using [real time api](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
- Error window displaying incorrect inputs and why
